# 🎤 ThreeWayChat - Voice-Controlled AI Development Assistant

**A revolutionary three-way conversation system between You, Cursor AI, and Grok AI through voice commands.**

## 🚀 **What This Is**

ThreeWayChat is a proof-of-concept for a voice-controlled AI assistant that enables seamless interaction between:
- **📱 You** (via iOS voice interface)
- **🤖 Cursor AI** (development assistance)
- **🧠 Grok AI** (conversational intelligence)

## ✨ **Key Features**

### 🎯 **Voice Control**
- Advanced speech-to-text with Voice Activity Detection (VAD)
- Automatic listening restart after responses
- Anti-feedback loop protection
- 5-second silence timeout for natural speech patterns

### 🤖 **Multi-AI Integration**
- **Grok-4** for conversational AI with 1000 token responses
- **Cursor AI** integration for programming assistance
- Smart context switching between AI models
- Extended memory system for conversation continuity

### 🔄 **Project Management**
- Voice-controlled project switching between multiple codebases
- API integration with external business tools
- Real-time WebSocket communication
- Self-enhancement capabilities

### 🧠 **Smart Context System**
- Comprehensive project ecosystem awareness
- Extended memory tracking errors, solutions, and interactions
- Context-aware responses based on conversation history
- Token-efficient context management

## 🏗️ **Architecture**

### **Frontend (iOS)**
- **Language**: Swift/SwiftUI
- **Speech**: SFSpeechRecognizer, AVSpeechSynthesizer
- **Networking**: URLSession WebSocket
- **File**: `ThreeWayChat/Voice control/Voice control/ContentView.swift`

### **Backend (Cloud)**
- **Framework**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Deployment**: Render Cloud Platform
- **WebSockets**: Real-time bidirectional communication
- **File**: `cloud_server.py`

### **AI Integration**
- **Cursor Integration**: Node.js WebSocket client (`real_cursor_integration.js`)
- **Grok API**: X.AI API integration with smart context
- **Project Switching**: Voice-controlled workspace management

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Voice Recognition Pipeline**
```
Voice Input → SFSpeechRecognizer → VAD → Context Analysis → AI Routing → Response
```

### **AI Response Flow**
```
User Voice → Server → Context Building → Grok/Cursor → Smart Response → TTS → User
```
