## How It Works

1. **Context Sharing**: Extension automatically shares your current file, line number, and selected code
2. **Voice Query**: You ask Grok a question via voice
3. **Smart Response**: Grok sees your actual code and provides specific advice
4. **Real-time Updates**: As you switch files, Grok stays aware of your context

## Example Conversations

**You**: "This function is returning undefined, can you help?"

**Grok** (can now see your code): "Looking at your `calculateTotal.js` file, I can see on line 15 you're missing a return statement in your if block. Here's the fix..."

**You**: "Explain what this code does"

**Grok**: "This React component in `UserProfile.tsx` appears to be handling user authentication. I can see you're using hooks for state management..."

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Connecting
- Check that your ThreeWay Chat server is running
- Verify the server URL in extension settings
- Look for errors in Cursor's Developer Console
